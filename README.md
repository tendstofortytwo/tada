# tada

tada is a slideshow system written in HTML, CSS, and JS, and styled to look like [my blog](https://prose.nsood.in/). the various branches on this repository should, over time, become the various talks that I have given. the `main` branch hosts the latest version of tada, until I can figure out some better way to separate logic and prose.

you can serve it with any ol' HTTP server:

```
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

and visit `localhost:3000/tada.html` to see the slideshow.
